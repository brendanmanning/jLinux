jLinux: A realistic java emulator for any Java compadible operating system.

What is jLinux? - jLinux provides a Linux-styled command line interface for users of Macintosh, Windows, and yes Linux itself. 

Why use jLinux? - There are serveral reasons ;)
  + No need for any external programs or libraries, jLinux only needs Java and a terminal.
  + (Windows users) Use a simple Linux enviroment without Cygwin.
  + Still use your operating system and file setup! jLinux stores all it's data in a folder named 'hdd' inside your user folder
      ++ (You also have to install the program somewhere, but hopefully you know that!!)
