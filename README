IMPORTANT: While reading source code is great, I suggest downloading the binary Windows installer from https://jlinux.net, or
by using the lastest jLinux JAR file (also found at https://jlinux.net and starting it in a shell with: 
java -jar <jLinux Jar Location>

jLinux: A realistic java emulator for any Java compadible operating system.

What is jLinux? - jLinux provides a Linux-styled command line interface for users of Macintosh, Windows, and yes Linux itself. 

Why use jLinux? - There are serveral reasons ;)
  + No need for any external programs or libraries, jLinux only needs Java and a terminal.
  + (Windows users) Use a simple Linux enviroment without Cygwin.
  + Still use your operating system and file setup! jLinux stores all it's data in a folder named 'hdd' inside your user folder (or desktop folder)
      ++ (You also have to install the program somewhere, but hopefully you know that!!)

What commands does jLinux have?
  - cd : Change directory
  - mkdir : Make directory
  - ls : List contents of current working directory
  - vinf : Vi new file (Creates new text file and let's you edit it)
  - dl : Equivalent of wget and cURL.
  - echo : Returns entered text or system parameters ($OS or $VERSION)
  - quit : Obviously ;)
  - help : Help pages being added for many programs
  - addapp : jLinux Package Manager
  - listapps : returns all apps installed via 'addapp'
  - cp : copy command

How can I support jLinux? 
  - Tell your friends!

How is jLinux liscensed?
  - jLinux is released under the MIT Liscense, although future "pro" versions with extra features may be liscensed differently. 
  - Users are permitted to distibute and modify jLinux source code as long as it follows the MIT Liscense.
  - However, I ask that if jLinux is useful to you, remember to take a break before you forget what sunlight feels like!

jLinux Credits - 
  + Various code adapted from various StackOverflow posts
  + Much of the code for 'dl' has been taken from Alvin Alexander's post at [[ http://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/java/jget-something-like-wget ]]
  + Brendan Manning (developer)
